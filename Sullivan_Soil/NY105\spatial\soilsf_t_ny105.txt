"NY105"|5|"BPI"|"Borrow pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed, usually for construction purposes.  Typically 0.5 to 3 acres.|"179902"
"NY105"|5|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, produced by erosion or faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed material is hard or soft bedrock.|"179903"
"NY105"|5|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel.  Typically 0.5 to 3 acres.|"179904"
"NY105"|5|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, of rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area with less than 15 percent fragments.  Typically 0.1 to 3 acres.|"179905"
"NY105"|5|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area, intermittently or permanently covered by water.  Sedges, cattails, and rushes dominate marsh areas.  Trees or shrubs dominate swamps.  Typically 0.1 to 3 acres.|"179906"

"NY105"|5|"STN"|"Stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3 percent of the surface cover is rock fragments that are greater than 10 inches in diameter where the surrounding soil has less than 0.01 percent of the surface cover of stones.  Typically 0.1 to 3 acres.|"179912"
"NY105"|5|"STV"|"Very Stony spot"|A spot where 0.1 to 3 percent of the surface cover is rock fragments that are greater than 10 inches in diamater where the surrounding soil has less than 0.01 percent of the surface cover of stones. Typically 0.1 to 3 acres.|"179913"
"NY105"|5|"WET"|"Wet spot"|A somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained area that is at least two drainage classes wetter than the named soils in the surrounding map unit.  Typically 0.1 to 3 acres.|"179914"
